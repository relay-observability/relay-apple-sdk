# Contributing to Relay

Thank you for your interest in improving Relay!  
We're building a composable, vendor-neutral observability SDK for iOS — and we’d love your help.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Relay is designed to:
- Automatically capture performance and behavioral signals
- Enhance existing SDKs (not replace them)
- Be clean, composable, and developer-friendly

```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Add new modules in `Sources/`
- Follow SwiftPM module structure
- Write tests in `Tests/`
- Format with `swiftformat` if available

#### ✅ Pre-Commit Linting

To enable shared linting hooks:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
```

### 4. Commit and Push

## 🔍 Where to Contribute

- `RelayCore`: Core models and config
- `RelayGRDB`: GRDB performance tracing
- `RelayCoreData`: Core Data save/fetch profiling
- `RelaySwiftData`: SwiftData ModelContext instrumentation
- `RelayUI`: UI latency detection
- `RelayExporters`: Console, OTel, and custom exporters
- `RelayPlayground`: Tools to simulate signal emission for testing

## 🧪 Testing

Each module should have its own test target under `/Tests`.  
Use `XCTest`, and if mocking is required, prefer protocol-based injection.
