/**
 A generic telemetry event that Relay plugins emit and exporters handle.

 This struct represents a telemetry event with a unique identifier, a name, a timestamp, and a set of attributes.
 
 **Design Considerations:**
 - Uses strongly typed attributes via `TelemetryAttribute` instead of a fully dynamic type like `AnyCodable`.
 - This design preserves type information, enabling better performance and more precise handling in high-frequency scenarios,
   such as UI latency, network requests, and disk persistence.
 - The use of strongly typed attributes allows for optimized serialization and downstream processing, without the overhead of
   runtime type erasure.
